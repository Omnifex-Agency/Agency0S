# Agency OS: Project Status & Architecture Report

**Date:** January 05, 2026
**Version:** 1.0.0 (Release Candidate - UI Overhaul)
**Maintainer:** Antigravity (Senior Frontend Architect)

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Agency OS has undergone a complete visual and structural transformation. We have successfully transitioned from a functional prototype to a "State of the Art" enterprise SaaS application. The platform now features a premium "Obsidian & Electric Indigo" aesthetic, a responsive Bento Grid dashboard, and a highly interactive, glassmorphic user interface. The core logic handles the entire agency lifecycle: Targets -> Pipeline -> Clients -> Projects -> Tasks.

**Current Status:**  
- **Frontend Codebase:** `Stable` & `Polished`
- **UI/UX:** `Premium` (Obsidian Theme implemented)
- **Backend Connection:** `Pending Configuration` (Missing API Keys)

## 2. Technical Stack & Architecture

### Core Frameworks
*   **Frontend**: Next.js 16.1.1 (App Router)
*   **Language**: TypeScript 5
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (Arbitrary values + CSS Variables)
*   **Component System**: Shadcn/UI (Radix UI Primitives)

### Key Libraries (Added in UI Overhaul)
*   **`framer-motion`**: Powering the collapsible sidebar transitions, entry animations, and hover effects.
*   **`recharts`**: Rendering the high-fidelity revenue area charts on the dashboard.
*   **`@tanstack/react-table`**: Managing complex data grids with sticky headers and sorting.
*   **`lucide-react`**: Consistent, stroke-width calibrated icon set.

### Database & State

*   **State Management**: TanStack Query v5 (Server State)

## 3. The "Obsidian" Design System

We completely refactored the design system to achieve a "Linear-like" premium feel.

### 3.1 Color Palette
*   **Backgrounds**: Deep Slate (`#0f172a` - Slate 950) for infinite depth.
*   **Accents**: Electric Indigo (`#6366f1`) for primary actions and focus rings.
*   **Success**: Teal (`#14b8a6`) for growth metrics and positive states.
*   **Glassmorphism**: Heavy use of `backdrop-blur-xl`, `bg-slate-900/50`, and `border-white/10` to create hierarchy without heavy shadows.

### 3.2 Key UI Components
*   **Collapsible Sidebar**: A fully animated navigation dock. It expands/collapses with a spring physics animation (`stiffness: 200`) and features a glowing active-tab indicator.
*   **Bento Grid Dashboard**: The main view (`/app/page.tsx`) uses a CSS Grid layout to organize key metrics, charts, and activity feeds into a clean, cohesive "Bento Box" structure.
*   **Micro-Interactions**:
    *   **Inputs**: Glow with an Indigo ring upon focus.
    *   **Cards**: entry animations (`opacity` + `y-axis` slide) on page load.
    *   **Links**: Subtle background fade-ins on hover.

## 5. Critical Action Items

While the code is pushed and stable, the application is currently **offline** due to missing credentials.

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED
The `.env.local` file currently contains placeholders. The app crashes with `ENOTFOUND` errors because it cannot reach Supabase.

**Action:** Update `.env.local` with valid keys:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[YOUR-PROJECT-ID].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[YOUR-ACTUAL-ANON-KEY]
```

### Next Steps (Post-Fix)
1.  **Verify Data connection**: Ensure the new dashboard charts pull real data (currently using skeletons/static data where DB is empty).
2.  **Storage Setup**: Enable Supabase Storage buckets for the new "Research" module file uploads.
3.  **Mobile Polish**: specific media query adjustments for the Bento Grid on mobile devices.
